When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
to be ready sharing the current version to other, to finish version normally take more that commit

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
forks : a clone of repository from another GitHub account to my GitHub account
clones : a clone of repository from an account on GitHub(my account or an other account) to my own computer
branches : lable for commit in a repository (locally or on GitHub)


What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
to see if there are change in GitHub repository with a collaborator or form me using GitHub editor
